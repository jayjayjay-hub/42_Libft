	<b><i>YOUR VERY FIRST OWN LIBRARY</i></b><br>

## 💡 About the project

> _The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you'll be allowed to use in all your other projects._

	Programming in C can be very tedious when you don't have access to the very useful standard functions.
	This project gives you the opportunity to rewrite those functions to understand them and learn to use them.
	The library will help you for your future projects in C. Through this project, you have the opportunity
	to extend your list of functions in your own way!

## List of functions:

### Functions from `<ctype.h>` library

* ft_isascii
* ft_isalnum
* ft_isalpha
* ft_isdigit
* ft_isprint
* ft_isspace

* ft_toupper

### Functions from `<stdlib.h>` library

* ft_atoi
* ft_calloc
* ft_abs

### Functions from `<strings.h>` library

* ft_bzero
* ft_memset
* ft_memchr
* ft_memcmp
* ft_memmove
* ft_memcpy

### Functions from `<string.h>` library

* ft_strlen
* ft_strchr
* ft_strrchr
* ft_strnstr
* ft_strncmp

## 🚀 Updates

### Additional Projects

#### [get_next_line](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/get_next_line)

> _This project, [get_next_line](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/get_next_line), has been integrated into this `libft` as an additional feature._

- The [get_next_line](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/get_next_line) project is designed to read a line from a file descriptor.

#### [ft_printf](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/ft_printf)

> _Another project, [ft_printf](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/ft_printf), has been added to this `libft` as well._

- [ft_printf](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/ft_printf) is a lightweight function to the standard printf function.

These additions extend the utility of the `libft` library, providing you with a broader range of functions to leverage in your projects at 42tokyo.


## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and needs the **`cc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile the library, go to its path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Cleaning all binary (.o) and executable files (.a)**

To clean all files generated while doing a make, go to the path and run:

```shell
$ make fclean
```
